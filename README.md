# React Navigation

React Navigation is a popular library for managing navigation in React Native applications. It allows you to create navigational structures such as:

Stack Navigation: For navigating between screens in a stack-like manner (e.g., moving forward/backward between pages).<br/><br/>
Tab Navigation: For switching between screens using bottom or top tabs.<br/><br/>
Drawer Navigation: For sliding menu-style navigation from the side.<br/><br/>
It provides easy-to-use APIs for creating and handling transitions, passing data between screens, and customizing navigational components. React Navigation is widely used for its flexibility and community support.
